 abstract = {{\textless}strong class={\textquotedbl}journal-contentHeaderColor{\textquotedbl}{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Data collected by two automatic weather stations (AWS) on the Larsen C ice shelf, Antarctica, between 22 January 2009 and 1 February 2011 are analyzed and used as input for a model that computes the surface energy budget (SEB), which includes melt energy. The two AWSs are separated by about 70 km in the north--south direction, and both the near-surface meteorology and the SEB show similarities, although small differences in all components (most notably the melt flux) can be seen. The impact of subsurface absorption of shortwave radiation on melt and snow temperature is significant, and discussed. In winter, longwave cooling of the surface is entirely compensated by a downward turbulent transport of sensible heat. In summer, the positive net radiative flux is compensated by melt, and quite frequently by upward turbulent diffusion of heat and moisture, leading to sublimation and weak convection over the ice shelf. The month of November 2010 is highlighted, when strong westerly flow over the Antarctic Peninsula led to a dry and warm f{\"o}hn wind over the ice shelf, resulting in warm and sunny conditions. Under these conditions the increase in shortwave and sensible heat fluxes is larger than the decrease of net longwave and latent heat fluxes, providing energy for significant melt.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

 abstract = {We present twenty-three years (1993?2016) of automatic weather station (AWS) data, collected along the K-transect near Kangerlussuaq in west Greenland. The transect runs from east to west, roughly perpendicular to the ice sheet edge at about 67°~N. The K-transect originated from the Greenland Ice Margin Experiments (GIMEX), held in the summers of 1990 and 1991. Until recently, surface mass balance and ice velocity measurements were performed at nine locations along the K-transect, of which four are equipped with AWS: two in the ablation zone at approximately 500~m and 1,000~m asl, one at the approximate equilibrium-line altitude ({\~{}}1,500~m asl), and one in the lower accumulation zone ({\~{}}1,850~m asl) at distances of 5, 38, 88, and 140~km from the ice edge, respectively. Here, we present an overview of the various AWS types and their data corrections, quality, and availability, including a preliminary trend analysis. Recent increases in temperature and radiation components are associated with the frequent occurrence of anti-cyclonic conditions in west Greenland, resulting in clear skies and relatively warm summers. Strong melt concurs with a decrease in winter accumulation, lowering the surface albedo of the ice sheet. The AWS situated at 1,500~m asl, the former equilibrium-line altitude (ELA), observed almost a doubling of the summertime net shortwave radiation since 2004; as a result, the ELA along the K-transect has been steadily increasing and is currently situated well above 1,700~m asl.},

 abstract = {Wildfire events have recently shown a rapid increase in frequency and scale due to the warmer present-day climate; however, their potential effects on the cryosphere are difficult to assess. Catastrophic wildfires in Australia during 2019--2020 emitted large amounts of light-absorbing particles (LAPs) to the atmosphere. Satellite observations indicate that these LAPs caused unprecedented snow-darkening of glaciers in New Zealand through long-range transport and deposition, with their effects lasting for up to three months in January--March 2020, influencing {\textgreater}90{\%} of total glacier/snow and leading to a mean broadband snow-reflectance reduction of 0.08 $\pm$ 0.03. This snow darkening accelerated snowmelt by {\~{}}0.41 $\pm$ 0.2~cm day--1 during the southern summer, equivalent to that caused by a {\~{}}1.8°C increase in air temperature. This indicates the significant impact of the 2019--2020 Australian wildfires on the hydrologic cycle in New Zealand, exceeding that of the local climate warming of {\~{}}1.5°C since the preindustrial period. Wildfire-induced snow darkening is not limited to New Zealand. Future projections of wildfire incidence indicate widespread effects of snow darkening on the global cryosphere.},
